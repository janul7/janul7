### 🚀 Featured Projects

> Add GitHub repo links for each project once they’re public.

**Auto-Adaptive Fine-Tuning of LLMs with JAC-MTLLM**  
Built an auto-adaptive, multi-tenant LLM fine-tuning pipeline that harvests interaction data, filters it, and fine-tunes TinyLlama models for cost-efficient local deployment. Includes validation-driven routing between local fine-tuned models and larger models, with background LoRA/QLoRA training and automatic hosting.  
_Stack: Jac Language, TinyLlama, Hugging Face, LoRA/QLoRA, FastAPI, Python, React, Vite_

**Travel Buddy — Multi-Agent Travel Planning System**  
Designed a multi-agent LLM backend where a Supervisor/Orchestrator decomposes user requests and coordinates agents for RAG content, currency, weather, and local events. Implemented daily ETL (scrape → clean → chunk → embed → index) into a vector DB plus real-time APIs with caching, guardrails, and unified JSON contracts.  
_Stack: Python, FastAPI, LangChain/LangGraph, Vector DB, Cron/ETL, OpenWeather, ExchangeRate-API_

**AutoDoc — End-to-End Multi-Agent Doctor Appointment Booker**  
Built a supervisor-led multi-agent workflow (Intent/Entity → Provider Search → Availability & Scheduling → Confirmation) with schema-validated handoffs, retries/backoff, timezone/conflict checks, and execution tracing. Supports fully automated doctor-appointment flows.  
_Stack: Python, LangGraph/LangChain, REST/HTTP APIs, Pydantic_

**Conversational RAG Application (LangChain & OpenAI)**  
End-to-end RAG assistant that ingests PDFs, performs chunking → embeddings → Chroma indexing, and answers queries with source-grounded responses while maintaining chat history and context.  
_Stack: LangChain, OpenAI, Chroma, PyPDFLoader, Python_

**Data Warehousing & BI Project**  
Designed a dimensional warehouse schema, built the DW in SQL Server, created ETL packages, and delivered interactive dashboards in Power BI.  
_Stack: MS SQL Server, SSIS, Power BI, Data Warehousing_
